# offline-issues

Get your GitHub Issues offline!

## But how?

- Have [Node.js]() installed on computer.
- Install this module `npm install -g offline-issues`
- Authorize it by running `offline-issues` and following the commands
- Use it to save Issues as .md and html!

**CLI**

```
# Use this format:
$ offline-issues USER/REPO#0
# So for example:
$ offline-issues jlord/offline-issues#1
# You can do multiple:
$ offline-issues jlord/offline-issues#1 muan/github-gmail/#4
```

Whatever directory you are in, it will create a `md` and `html` folder with the resulting files.

**TADA**
